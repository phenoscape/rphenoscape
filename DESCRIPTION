Description: Provides convenient access to the data, ontologies, and semantics-based
  analytics offered by the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB) API. The KB integrates
  morphological trait data curated from phylogenetic systematics studies with
  morphological phenotypes of model organism gene knock-outs, all linked to the
  same shared ontologies in the Entity-Quality (EQ) formalism. The available
  capabilities include finding ontology terms; finding studies by taxon and anatomical
  concepts, and obtaining their trait matrices; finding ontological phenotype
  expressions; generating synthetic presence-absence trait matrices; obtaining
  anatomical presence-absence dependency matrices; and computing semantic similarity
  metrics between traits.
