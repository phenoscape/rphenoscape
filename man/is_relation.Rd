\title{Test which candidate terms are ancestors or descendants of a term}
\usage{
is_descendant(term, candidates, includeRels = c("none", "part_of"))

is_ancestor(term, candidates, includeRels = c("none", "part_of"))
}
\arguments{
\item{term}{character, the label (name) or IRI of the query term}

\item{candidates}{character, the list of candidate term names or IRIs}

\item{includeRels}{character, the relationships R for which to include
subclasses of expressions "R \emph{some} T", where for \code{is_descendant} T is the
query term, and for \code{is_ancestor} it is a candidate term.
At present, the only option is \code{"part_of"}, which will typically only make
sense for anatomy terms. The default is not to include these.}
}
\value{
A logical vector indicating which candidate terms are ancestors and
descendants, respectively, of the query term.
}
\description{
Tests which in a list of candidate terms are ancestors to or descendants of
the query term. Note that terms are not considered ancestors and descendants
of themselves.
}
\details{
Any of both the query term and the list of candidate terms can be supplied
as labels (names), or as IRIs. The function will first resolve any labels
to IRIs, allowing any ontology as the target. If labels aren't unique enough
across ontologies, it is advisable to do the resolution before calling these
functions, using \code{\link[=get_term_iri]{get_term_iri()}} with the appropriate ontology set.
