\title{Find the IRI of the term matching a text query}
\usage{
get_term_iri(text, as, exactOnly = FALSE, nomatch = NA,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{character. The search text to be resolved.}

\item{as}{character. The ontology or ontologies as which to find the term.
Can be provided in several ways: (1) IRI of the ontology; (2) the ID space
for OBO ontologies such as UBERON, VTO, etc; (3) \code{"anatomy"} and \code{"taxon"}
as shorthand for all anatomy and taxon ontologies, respectively; (4) NA to
disable any filtering by defining ontology. Options (1) and (2) can be
combined. There is no default.}

\item{exactOnly}{logical. Whether to require an exact match. If TRUE, only
the first exact match is returned. Default is FALSE.}

\item{nomatch}{the value to return if there is no match, by default NA.}

\item{verbose}{logical: optional. If TRUE, prints messages prior to potentially
time-consuming operations. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
The IRI if a match is found.
}
\description{
Finds the term matching the query text, and returns its IRI. If the query
text is already a IRI, it is returned as is.
}
\details{
This uses \link{find_term} to find matches, and assumes that the term of interest
is a class. If there is an exact match, its IRI will be returned. If there
isn't, by default partial, and as a last resort broad, matches will also be
considered, although this will result in a warning.
