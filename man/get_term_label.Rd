\usage{
get_term_label(term_iris, preserveOrder = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{term_iris}{character, a list of term IRIs}

\item{preserveOrder}{logical, whether the resulting data frame (see Value)
is to be in the same row order as \code{termIRIs}. The default is not to preserve
order.}

\item{verbose}{logical, whether to print information about possibly
time-consuming operations.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns "id" and "label". The "id" column contains
the IRIs. The label will be \code{NA} for term IRIs that are not present in the
KB, or for which the KB cannot produce a label.
}
\description{

list. Terms for which no label is found in the database will have NA as the
label in the result (see Value).
