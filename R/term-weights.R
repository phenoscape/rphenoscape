#' Obtains term frequencies for the Phenoscape KB
#'
#' Determines the frequencies for the given input list of terms, based on
#' the selected corpus.
#'
#' Depending on the corpus selected, the frequencies are queried directly
#' from pre-computed counts through the KB API, or are calculated based on
#' matching row counts obtained from query results. Currently, the Phenoscape KB
#' has precomputed counts for corpora "taxa" and "genes". Calculated counts for
#' the "taxon_annotations" corpus are most reliable for phenotype terms and their
#' subsumers. For entity terms, subsumers can include many generated
#' post-composed terms (such as "part_of some X", where X is, for example, an
#' anatomy term), and at least currently these aren't handled correctly by the
#' Phenoscape KB, resulting in counts of zero for such terms. For some of these
#' the implementation here will try to rewrite the query (see parameter
#' `decodeIRI`), but this only works to a limited extent.
#' @note
#' Term categories being accurate is vital for obtaining correct counts and
#' thus frequencies. Auto-determining term categories yields reasonably accurate
#' results, but with caveats. One, it can be time-consuming, and two, especially
#' for entity terms and their subsumers it is often not 100% accurate. This
#' function will try to correct for that by assuming that if not all terms
#' are determined to be of the same category, but one category holds for more
#' than 90% of the terms, that it must be the correct category for all terms.
#' If the list of terms is legitimately of different categories, it is best to
#' determine (and possibly correct) categories beforehand, and then pass the
#' result as `as`. If all terms are of the same category and the category is
#' known beforehand, it saves time and prevents potential errors to supply this
#' category using `as`.
#' @param x a vector or list of one or more terms, either as IRIs or as term
#'   objects.
#' @param as the category or categories of the input terms (see [term_category()]).
#'   Supported categories are "entity", "quality", and "phenotype". The value
#'   must either be a single category (applying to all terms), or a vector of
#'   categories (of same length as `x`). If provided as "auto" (or NULL), the
#'   category of each term is automatically determined. The default is "auto".
#' @param corpus the name of the corpus for which to determine frequencies.
#'   Supported values are "taxon_annotations", "taxa", "gene_annotations", and
#'   "genes". (At present, support for "gene_annotations" is pending support in
#'   the Phenoscape API.) The default is "taxon_annotations".
#' @param decodeIRI boolean. If TRUE (the default), attempt to decode
#'   post-composed entity IRIs, and under certain circumstances rewrite the
#'   count query according to the results. At present, this is used only for
#'   entity IRIs detected as "part_of some X" post-compositions, and only for
#'   the "taxon_annotations" corpus. In those cases, the count query will be
#'   rewritten to first query for X, then for X including parts, and the resulting
#'   count is the result of the latter minus that of the former.
#'
#'   The decoding algorithm may be imprecise, so one may want to turn this off,
#'   the result of which will usually be a frequency of zero for those IRIs, due
#'   to limitations in the Phenoscape KB API.
#' @param ... additional query parameters to be passed to the function querying
#'   for counts, see [pkb_args_to_query()]. Currently this is only used for
#'   corpus "taxon_annotations", and the only useful parameter is `includeRels`,
#'   which can be used to include historical and serial homologues in the counts.
#'   It can also be used to always include parts for entity terms.
#' @return a vector of frequencies as floating point numbers (between zero
#'   and 1.0), of the same length (and ordering) as the input list of terms.
