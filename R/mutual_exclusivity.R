#' @param phenotype.a character or phenotype object, phenotype ID (IRI) if character, or

#' @param phenotype.b character or phenotype object, phenotype ID (IRI) if character, or

#' mutual exclusivity is to be based only on the evidence found in a particular set of studies.
#' The default is NULL, which means

#' @param charstates dataframe, a dataframe obtained from [charstates()] by
#' passing a list of the two phenotypes as argument. This optional parameter exists to speed up

#' Determine mutual exclusivity between two or more phenotypes
#'
#' Determines whether the data in the KB includes evidence for mutual exclusivity
#' between all distinct pairs of phenotypes in the provided list.
#' 
#' Evidence for mutual exclusivity or compatibility between a pair of phenotypes
#' is taken from how they are or aren't linked to the same taxon, character, and
#' character state. If two phenotypes are found to be linked to the same character
#' state at least once, it is considered _strong evidence for mutual compatibility_.
#' If they are found to be linked to the same character at least once, but not
#' to the same character state (implying they must be linked to different states of
#' the same character at least once), it is considered _strong evidence for mutual exclusivity_.
#' Otherwise, if there is no character to which both are linked, the presence and absence
#' of data showing co-occurrence in taxa is used as _weak evidence_. That is, if they are
#' linked to character states of different characters, but the states are both exhibited
#' by the same taxon at least once, it is considered as _weak evidence for mutual compatibility_
#' (weak because the co-occurrence may be due to taxon-level polymorphism),
#' and if there is no such taxon, this is considered as _weak evidence for mutual exclusivity_
#' (because lack of evidence could still be due to gaps in the data, and does therefore not
#' imply evidence of absence).
#' 
#' It is possible that for any pair of phenotypes the KB contains conflicting
#' evidence on mutual exclusivity. For example, two phenotypes could be linked to
#' the same character state for one character, and different character states for
#' another character (possibly from another study by another author), the first of
#' which would present strong evidence for mutual compatibility and the latter
#' strong evidence of mutual exclusivity. The current implementation does not detect
#' and thus ignores this possibility.
#'
#' @param phenotypes character or phenotype, a vector of phenotype IDs, or
#' phenotype objects for which one wants to determine the mutual exclusivity.
#' @param studies character, a vector of study IDs (optional) if one is
#' interested in determining mutual exclusivity only based on the evidence from a
#' particular set of studies. By default _all_ studies in the KB are considered.
#' @param progress_bar logical, whether to print progress of the function.
#'
#' WARNING: setting progress_bar to TRUE clears the R console by executing the
#' cat('\014') command before printing the progress.
#'
#' @return A list consisting a matrix and a dataframe that contain mutual exclusivity
#' results for the phenotypes.
#' 
#' The mutual exclusivity type between two phenotypes is encoded as an ordered factor with the following
#' levels (in this order):
#' - 'strong_compatibility'  : the data show strong evidence of mutual compatibility;
#' - 'weak_compatibility'    : the data suggest mutual compatibility, but the evidence is weak;
#' - 'inconclusive_evidence' : the default for phenotypes that lack links to character states;
#' - 'weak_exclusivity'      : the data suggest mutual exclusivity, but the evidence is weak;
#' - 'strong_exclusivity'    : the data show strong evidence of mutual exclusivity.
#'
#' The first item in the list is a square matrix with each dimension equal to the
#' number of phenotypes. The cells (_i_,_j_) of the matrix are the integer representation of
#' the factor level for the mutual exclusivity type between the _i_ th and _j_ th phenotype
#' in the list of phenotypes provided as input. The matrix is symmetric.
#'
#' The second item in the list is a dataframe with five columns, the labels and ids
#' of each phenotype of a pair, and the mutual exclusivity type of the pair is in the
#' fifth column.
