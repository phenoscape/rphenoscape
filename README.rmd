# RPhenoscape: Semantically rich phenotypic traits from the Phenoscape Knowledgebase

[![Build Status](https://github.com/phenoscape/rphenoscape/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/phenoscape/rphenoscape/actions)

- Author: Hong Xu, Hilmar Lapp, John Bradley
- Maintainer: Hilmar Lapp

Most of the services provided with the [Phenoscape Knowledgebase web API](http://kb.phenoscape.org/apidocs/) return data in JSON format, plain text (usually tab-delimited), and NeXML. This package facilitates interfacing with the Phenoscape Knowledgebase for searching ontology terms, retrieving term info, and querying data matrices.


## Installation
The development version of RPhenoscape is available on [Github](http://github.com/phenoscape/rphenoscape). It has not yet been released to [CRAN]. To install RPhenoscape from Github, use the `install_github()` function in the `remotes` package (which can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages()`):


```{r compile-settings, include=FALSE}
## Set the paths for cache and figure
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(cache = 1)
basename <- gsub(".Rmd", "", knitr:::knit_concord$get('infile')) 
opts_chunk$set(fig.path = paste("figure/", basename, "-", sep=""),
               cache.path = paste("cache/", basename, "/", sep=""))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(upload.fun = imgur_upload)
opts_chunk$set(tidy=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment = NA, verbose = TRUE)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("phenoscape/rphenoscape")
```

By default, this will skip building the package vignettes. To build and install package vignettes as well, you must have recent versions of the `knitr` and `rmarkdown` packages installed, and use additional parameters, depending on the version of the `remotes` package you have installed, to request building vignettes.

```{r}
packageVersion("remotes")
```

If the version is 2.1.0 or higher, use the `build_vignettes` parameter (which by default is FALSE):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("phenoscape/rphenoscape", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
If the version of `remotes` is lower, use the `build_opts` parameter:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("phenoscape/rphenoscape", build_opts=c("--no-manual"))
```

Once installed, the package can be loaded ("attached") as any other R package:
```{r}
library(rphenoscape)
```

## Package Usage Information
The functionality and operations of the RPhenoscape package can be viewed on the dedicated package website: <http://rphenoscape.phenoscape.org/>

[Use cases] described there include the following:

- Using OntoTrace to obtain a character matrix
- Obtaining the character matrices for studies published for a taxonomic clade
- Subsetting matrices by taxonomic subgroup or anatomical part
- Searching for details for a given taxon
