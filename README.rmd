# rphenoscape: Semantically rich phenotypic traits from the Phenoscape Knowledgebase

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phenoscape/rphenoscape.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phenoscape/rphenoscape)

* Maintainer: Hong Xu
* Author: Hong Xu, Hilmar Lapp


Most of the services provided with [Phenoscape Knowledgebase web API](http://kb.phenoscape.org/apidocs/) return data in JSON format, plain text (usually tab-delimited), and NeXML. This package facilitates the interfacing to the Phenoscape Knowledge for searching ontology terms, retrieving term info, and querying data matrices. 


## Getting Started
The development version of rphenoscape is available on [Github](www.github.com/phenoscape/rphenoscape). With the `devtools` package installed on your system, rphenoscape can be installed using:


```{r compile-settings, include=FALSE}
## Set the paths for cache and figure
library(methods)
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(cache = 1)
basename <- gsub(".Rmd", "", knitr:::knit_concord$get('infile')) 
opts_chunk$set(fig.path = paste("figure/", basename, "-", sep=""),
               cache.path = paste("cache/", basename, "/", sep=""))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(upload.fun = imgur_upload)
opts_chunk$set(tidy=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment = NA, verbose = TRUE)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("phenoscape/rphenoscape", build_opts=c("--no-manual"))
library(rphenoscape)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(rphenoscape)
```

The option `build_opts` ensures that the vignettes will be built and installed
as well. This will require a recent version of the knitr and rmarkdown
packages. You can install these beforehand, or include the option
`dependencies=TRUE`. The latter will also install packages otherwise only
needed for testing and for generating the help pages, which, if you don't
develop packages yourself, may be much more than you need.

## Package Usage Information
The functionality and operations of the RPhenoscape package can be viewed on the dedicated package website:

http://kb.phenoscape.org/apidocs/

*Among the functions described on the package website are:*
Using Ontotrace to obtain a character matrix
Obtaining the character matrices for studies published for a taxonomic clade
Subsetting matricies by taxonomic subgroup or anatomical part
Searching for details for a given taxon
